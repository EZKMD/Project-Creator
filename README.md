# Project Creator

This program creates project folders and files depending on **user requirements**.

This project is fitted to my personal needs, hence the strange file position. Essentially, to create a project I would have to create all the files,
etc. Furthermore, I work from a PC and a laptop, therefore I have to seperate coding files (yes one is nested within the other) therefore that option
 is also there to choose from. Then it creates all folders in the encessary language folders and creates files if they are conventionally named e.g. main.py or index.html

 Most aspects of this project is tailored to my system, however changes can easily be made in paths and language names to fit another.
